# Mini-V

Mini-V is a compact core-xy printer with a build volume of 180mm³ using 2020 extrusions. The printer is designed to maximize print volume with a minimal footprint.

*The design is stable with over 400 hours of print time on two alpha builds. As of mid-2024 we are entering an open beta and looking for early adopters.*
